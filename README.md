# Test Marcos

This is an application that handles onsales property search and details.
I implemented the application using the folloing stacks:

- React
- Vite (https://vitejs.dev/)
- React hook form (https://react-hook-form.com/)
- RTK (https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- Yup (https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup)
- Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Daisy UI (https://daisyui.com/)
- consist in the use of the main stacks React + TypeScript + Vite

# Datasource

The datasource is a URL json content. So I used a RTK API to manage the communication with the
datasource. It maitaine cached requests and provides many features for middlewares and state managhement.

# Form validation

For form validation I used YUP which provides flexible features and integrates well with React Hook form

# UI

I used Tailwind CSS which is pretty productive and flexible framework along with Daisy UI which provides nice
component out of the box.
